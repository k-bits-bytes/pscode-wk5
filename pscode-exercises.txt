// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2, and sum of integer/numeric type.
Step 3: Read inputs/values for num1, num2.
Step 4: Calculate sum = num1 + num2
Step 5: Stop

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variable num1 of integer/numeric type.
Step 3: Read input/value for num1
Step 4: If (num1 mod 2) equals 0
Step 5:    Display "Number is Even"
Step 6: Else
Step 7:    Display "Number is Odd"
Step 8: End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare and initialize a numeric array numArr of size 5 to store the numbers.
Step 3: Declare and initialize variables sum, avg, min, and max.
Step 4: For i from 1 to 5 (inclusive):
   Step 4.1: Read input/value for numArr[i]
   Step 4.2: Calculate sum = sum + numArr[i] 
   Step 4.3: If i is 1, set min and max to numArr[i].
   Step 4.4: Else, if numArr[i] is less than min, update min to numArr[i].
   Step 4.5: Else, if numArr[i] is greater than max, update max to numArr[i].
Step 5: Calculate the average as follows:
   Step 5.1: Divide sum by 5 and store the result in the variable avg.
Step 6: Display "The average of the five numbers is " avg.
Step 7: Display "The smallest number among the five is " min.
Step 8: Display "The largest number among the five is " max.
Step 9: Stop
